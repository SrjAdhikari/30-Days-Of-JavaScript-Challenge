//* Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations

//* Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
const firstNum = 10;
const secondNum = 20;
const result = firstNum + secondNum;
console.log(`Result is : ${result}`);               // Output -> Result is : 30


//* Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
const operand1 = 50;
const operand2 = 30;
const difference = operand1 - operand2;
console.log(`Difference is : ${difference}`);       // Output -> Difference is : 20


//* Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
const firstValue = 11;
const secondValue = 10;
const product = firstValue * secondValue;
console.log(`Product is : ${product}`);             // Output -> Product is : 110


//* Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
const divisor = 5;
const dividend = 40;
const quotient = dividend / divisor;
console.log(`Quotient is : ${quotient}`);           // Output -> Quotient is : 8


//* Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
const divisor1 = 5;
const dividend1 = 43;
const remainder = dividend1 % divisor1;
console.log(`Remainder is : ${remainder}`);         // Output -> Remainder is : 3
